## Markdown Format

Swift code is extracted from the Markdown with the same syntax used to specify languages for code blocks in GitHub-flavored Markdown. All other text is parsed normally as Markdown using [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).

    # A Swift Tour

    Tradition suggests that the first program in a new language should print the words "Hello, world"
    on the screen. In Swift, this can be done in a single line:

    ```swift
    println("Hello, world!")
    ```

## Installation

1. This tool requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Download the installer from the Node.js website and follow the instructions.

2. In your Terminal, run the following command to install the Playground Builder:

   ```sh
   $ npm install -g swift-playground-builder
   ```

3. That's it! You should now be able to use the `playground` command.

## Command-line Usage

```
Usage: playground <paths>... [options]

paths     Markdown files(s), or directory containing Markdown files,
          from which to build the Playground(s)

Options:

   -d, --destination   Directory in which to output the Playground(s);
                       defaults to the current working directory

   -p, --platform      Specifies which platform's frameworks can be imported
                       in the Playground(s); only one platform can be choosen
                       [options: ios, osx] [default: osx]

   -n, --noreset       Don't allow edited code to be reset from the
                       "Editor → Reset Playground" menu in Xcode

   -v, --version       Print swift-playground-builder version and exit
```

## Node.js Usage

You can also import the Playground Builder as a Node.js module.

```js
var playground = require('swift-playground-builder');

playground.createFromFile('file.md', options);
playground.createFromFiles(['file.md', 'directory/of/files/'], options);
playground.createFromString('String containing markdown.', options);
```

### Arguments

* **`paths` (`String` or `Array`)** or **`markdown` (`String`)**
  * `createFromFile` and `createFromFiles` expect a path to a Markdown file or directory containing Markdown files. An array of file and/or directory paths is also acceptable.
  * `createFromString` expects a string containing Markdown.

* **`options` (`Object`, optional)**
  See the "Options" section below for available options.

* **`callback` (`Function`, optional)**
  Function to be called once all Playground files have been output. First argument is `err` which contains an `Error`, if any.

### Options

* **`name` (default: `'MyPlayground'`)**
  When using `createFromString`, specify a name for the playground. The name will be used for
  the filename. (The `.playground` extension is appended automatically.)

* **`outputDirectory` (default: `process.cwd()`)**
  Path to directory in which to output the built Playground(s).

* **`allowsReset` (default: `true`)**
  A Playground's code can be modified and saved. The Playground can be reset to its original code from the "Editor → Reset Playground" menu. This menu can be disabled for a Playground by setting this option to `false`.`

* **`platform` (default: `'osx'`)**
  Set the platform to `osx` or `ios` to be able to import each platform's respective frameworks.


### Example

```js
var playground = require('swift-playground-builder');

// Outputs `Introduction.playground` to current working directory
playground.createFromFile('Introduction.md');

// Outputs `Variables.playground` to `/User/Jason/Playgrounds`
playground.createFromString(markdown, {
  name: 'Variables',
  outputDirectory: '/User/Jason/Playgrounds'
});

// outputs `Constants.playground` and `Closures.playground` to CWD
playground.createFromFiles(['Constants.md', 'Closures.md'], {
  allowsReset: false,
  platform: 'ios'
});

// outputs playgrounds for Markdown files in `./playgrounds` directory,
// then invokes callback function
playground.createFromFiles('./playgrounds', function(err) {
  if (err) { throw err; }
  console.log('Done building playgrounds!');
});
```

## Why Node.js?

You may be wondering why I chose to use Node.js for this project.

I wrote this script with the intention of using it as part of a web-based CMS. It would be awesome to have downloadable playgrounds when I post Swift-related articles on my website, and a huge time-saver if they are generated automatically from the post's Markdown. Although this version already works very well from the Terminal, I'd love to one day rewrite it in Swift itself.

If the fact that this is written in JavaScript is unappealing to you, I ask that you please give it a chance. Node is very easy to install — especially on OS X!  — and the Playground Builder is used just like any other command-line tool.
